# SCCU Namespace Definition
namespace_id: sccu
version: "1.0.0"
name: "Self-Contained Context Unit"
description: |
  SCCU is a methodology for building traceable, modular applications.
  Every line of code links to Business Goals (BC) and Analytical Contracts (AC).

  Key principles:
  - Layers of Truth: BC -> AC -> PC -> IC
  - Living Documentation: Delta-based updates to domain files
  - Workflow Enforcement: Phase-based development with validators

phases:
  - RELEASE
  - BC_DELTA
  - AC_DELTA
  - PLAN_FINALIZE
  - PC_CONTEXT
  - IC
  - QA_TESTING
