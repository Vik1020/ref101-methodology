## Scoring Calculator

### Step 1: Calculate Dimension Scores (0-100 scale)

```
Culture Score:         [Culture Average] × 20 = _____/100
Tech Maturity Score:   [Tech Average] × 20 = _____/100
Resources Score:       [Resources Average] × 20 = _____/100
Compliance Score:      [Compliance Average] × 20 = _____/100
Evolution Score:       [Evolution Average] × 20 = _____/100
```

### Step 2: Calculate Weighted Total

```
Total Readiness Score =
  (Culture Score × 0.30) +
  (Tech Maturity Score × 0.25) +
  (Resources Score × 0.20) +
  (Compliance Score × 0.15) +
  (Evolution Score × 0.10)

Total = _____/100
```
